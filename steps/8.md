# Finishing in style

## Add the footer

Let's add the final section on the page: the footer. Add the HTML below to the very end of the `<body>` section in `index.html`, after all other content. By now it should be clear what this HTML does.

```html
<footer>
  <div id="footer">
    <div>
      This page uses Google Custom Search API, Python, Flask, Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.
    </div>
  </div>
</footer>
```

Now we can see the footer on the page, but it's completely un-styled.  It's often easier to write CSS once you have elements to apply it to; otherwise you're writing CSS in the dark!

## Complete the styling

First, let's make sure everything is nicely centred. Remember how we set the background for the page?

```css
body {
  background-image: url(/images/ricepaper_v3.png)
}
```

Let's expand this CSS rule by adding a few more properties:

```css
body {
  background-image: url(/images/ricepaper_v3.png);
  text-align: center;
  color: rgb(0, 51, 63);
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This will make everything in the `<body>` element centred, the text dark grey, the font used will be Helvetica (and if that's not available for some reason, Arial), and the page will have zero margin and padding on the side. You can see the effect straight away.

Now let's add some style to the header:

```css
header {
  padding: 15px;
  background-color: rgba(255,255,255, 0.7);
  box-shadow: 1px 0 3px rgba(0,0,0, 0.3);
}
```

This gives it some padding, so the text is not as close to the edge of the page. It also applies some background colour. Here, `rgba(255,255,255, 0.7)` means white with the opacity of 70%. Finally, we apply some black shadow that's 3 pixels wide with 30% opacity. It will give the header volume.

Next let's add some styling to the first section (Step 1). It has the id of "select-image". Let's give it some background and some padding, like we have with the header:

```css
#select-image {
  background-color: rgba(255,255,255, 0.3);
  padding: 10px;
}
```

The `rgba(255,255,255,0.3)` means white background with 30% opacity.

We'll continue the styling with the second section.  It needs some colour and padding too. This time we'll use an off-white tinge. If we mix green and blue but leave out red, then the result will be cyan (greenish-blue). We'll set this background with a very low opacity; to show just a hint of this colour:

```css
  #add-text {
    background-color: rgba(0,255,255, 0.02);
    padding: 10px;
    box-shadow: 1px 0 3px rgba(0,0,0, 0.3);
  }
```

Let's also make the input box wider and set the alignment to `center`.

```css
#caption-text {
  width: 600px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

We'll make all input fields slightly larger by increasing the size of the font:

```css
input {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

And add some styles for section 3:

```css
#style-caption {
  background-color: rgba(255,255,255, 0.7);
  padding: 10px;
  box-shadow: 1px 0 3px rgba(0,0,0, 0.3);
}
```

Now the section itself looks a little bit better but the caption controls are a mess. Let's style them too:

First, some padding and the font size.

```css
#caption-controls {
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

Then, let's make the inputs of type 'number' fairly narrow:

```css
#caption-controls input[type="number"] {
  width: 50px;
}
```

We'll finish by styling with the footer. The content is ready but it looks terrible. First, the familiar tricks: background, shadows, padding, text alignment:

```css
footer {
  background-color: rgba(255,0,255,0.01);
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: left;
  font-size: 12px;
  box-shadow: -1px 0 5px rgba(0,0,0, 0.3);
}

#footer {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 800px;
}
```

Now it looks slightly better, but still not right. The lines of text are a bit close together. Since they are both in their own elements (`div`s), we can give them some space by adding margin above and below:

```css
footer div {
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-right: 0;
}
```

Actually, there's a shortcut in CSS, which we've used previously, for defining margins on a single line.  Have a look at your `application.css` file and see if you can find it.  If you can, try to use this pattern to define a 10 pixel margin top and bottom.

Spoiler alert! Here's how you do it (this replaces the four 'margin' lines used above):

```css
footer div {
  margin: 10px 0;
}
```

Cool! Now our footer looks much more organized.
