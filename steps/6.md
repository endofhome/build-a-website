# Completing the page content and styling

## Add the second section

The second section is similar to the first section, so you should understand how it works:

```html
<section id="add-text">
  <h2>Step 2. Add Text</h2>
  <input id="caption-text" type="text" value="Curiosity is one of the great secrets of happiness">
</section>
```

Add it right below the first section in `index.erb`.  If you refresh the page, it should have both sections in it:

![adding section 2](/images/step_6/adding_section_2.png)

## Add the 'workspace'

Add the third section - the 'workspace' - directly below section 2:

```html
<section id="style-caption">
  <h2>Step 3. Style it!</h2>
  <div id="workspace">
    <p id="caption"></p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Like we did with `search-results`, we've created a new element (`id="workplace"`) where our image and its associated caption will go. Since both the workspace and caption elements are empty, they will be invisible (just as our search results area was invisible in the first section).

## Style the workspace

It's been a while since we added any style to our page, so let's get back to some CSS.  We'll create a big red border around our workspace.  It won't bring us fame and fortune as web designers, but that's not the point. Add this to your `application.css`:

```css
#workspace {
  width: 600px;
  min-height: 300px;
  border: 5px dashed red;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This CSS means that the element with the id of `workspace` will have a width of 600 pixels, a minimum height of 300 pixels, it will have a 5-pixel dashed red border and will be centred (`margin: 0 auto;` means zero margin top and bottom, but an automatic margin left and on the right, which has the effect of centring the element).

Now the page looks different. Our workspace is visible, it has dimensions, a border around it and it's centred horizontally:

![styled workspace](/images/step_6/styled_workspace.png)

When the user clicks one of the thumbnail image search results, we want to load that image into the workspace.  To do that, we'll need some more JavaScript.  Add the following to `application.js`:

```javascript
$(document).on('click', '#search-results img', function() {
  var url = $(this).data('url');
  $("#workspace img").remove();
  var img = $("<img>").attr('src', url);
  $("#workspace").append(img);
});
```

Let's break it down line by line. You should be familiar with the first line. It says that when an element `#search-results img` (that is, any `<img>` element inside the search results area) is clicked, the code inside the function should be executed.

Line 2 simply gets the url of the source image from the thumbnail image element ( `$(this)` is the thumbnail that was clicked) and saves it into a variable called `url`. Line 3 removes all images inside `#workspace`. Line 4 creates a new empty image element then sets its `src` attribute the value of `url`.  This will cause the browser to load the source image into the element.  Finally, line 5 appends the image element to the workspace.

Now when we click a thumbnail, the current image in the workspace (if there is one) is removed, and a new image is created and added to the workspace.

Try it out in your browser.  Can you see a problem?

The source images can be many different sizes.  To ensure consistency we need to style the `img` element to have a set width.  Otherwise, large images will 'overflow' the workspace and small ones will fail to fill it.  Add this to `application.css` and the browser will scale images to fit:

```css
#workspace img {
  width: 600px;
}
```

Save all files and refresh your browser. Now, when you search for an image and click one of the results, it is loaded correctly into the workspace:

![image sized in workspace](/images/step_6/image_sized_in_workspace.png)

But what is the extra space between the image and the red border at the top? This is actually our caption element getting in the way. We don't want the caption to appear _before_ the image in this way, we actually want it to be _overlaid_ on the image.  Again, we can achieve this with some CSS in `application.css`:

```css
#caption {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
}

#workspace {
 position: relative;
}
```

> Note: you don't need to create a new `#workspace` section in `application.css` - you can add `position: relative;` to the existing one if you prefer.

Great, so now our caption is not messing up the layout; but it's also not appearing at all.  That's kinda dumb.  We want the caption to be whatever the user typed into Section 2. Do you remember we gave that input box the id `text`?  We can use some JavaScript to handle the `input` event for this field (which happens every time something is typed into the input box). Put this in your `application.js`:

```javascript
$(document).on('ready', function() {
  $("#caption").text($('#caption-text').val());
});

$(document).on('input', '#caption-text', function() {
  $("#caption").text($(this).val());
});
```

Try it - the caption should now be correctly initialized and change whenever the text in Section 2 changes:

![initialized caption](/images/step_6/initialized_caption.png)

But it's a bit underwhelming.  Let's use CSS to give it more impact! Amend the `#caption` section in `application.css`:

```css
#caption {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-family: Helvetica;
  text-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);
  width: 400px;
  font-size: 32px;
  color: red;
  margin: 0;
}
```

This should be fairly self-explanatory but if you are unsure please do go off and do some research into CSS.  Now the caption is much more noticeable:

## Add caption editing controls

By now our website is starting to resemble an end product. Let's add the caption editing controls. You've already seen how to add input elements to enter text. The input elements to enter numbers and drop-down boxes are not that different. So, here's the set of elements we're about to create:

![image controls](/images/step_6/image_controls.png)

First, we'll add a container element with an id of `caption-controls` after the workspace element:

```html
<div id="workspace">
  <p id="caption"></p>
</div>
<div id="caption-controls">
</div>
```

Now let's add the first input element for the left offset:.

```html
<div id="caption-controls">
  Left: <input type="number" value="10" id="caption-left">
</div>
```

This creates an input box of type "number" (as opposed to "text" that we've used so far). It behaves just like a text input but has two small arrows that allow you to increase or decrease the number. Now our page looks like this:

![first image control](/images/step_6/first_image_control.png)

Adding other number controls is very similar:

```html
<div id="caption-controls">
  Left: <input type="number" value="10" id="caption-left">
  Top: <input type="number" value="10" id="caption-top">
  Width: <input type="number" value="400" id="caption-width">
  Size: <input type="number" value="32" id="caption-size">
</div>
```

![other offset controls](/images/step_6/other_offset_controls.png)

Adding drop-down boxes is similar, but these use the `<select>` tag instead.  A `<select>` element can have child `<option>` elements, which determine the entries in the dropdown list.  Let's add the control for selecting colour inside the `#controls` element:

```html
<div id="caption-controls">
  Left: <input type="number" value="10" id="caption-left">
  Top: <input type="number" value="10" id="caption-top">
  Width: <input type="number" value="400" id="caption-width">
  Size: <input type="number" value="32" id="caption-size">
  Colour: <select id="caption-colour">
            <option>red</option>
            <option>green</option>
            <option>white</option>
            <option>black</option>
            <option>blue</option>
            <option>yellow</option>
            <option>gray</option>
            <option>orange</option>
          </select>
</div>
```

If you've done everything correctly, you should see it in your browser:

![colour select control](/images/step_6/colour_select_control.png)

Add the 'Align' dropdown box using similar code.  The options are 'left', 'center' and 'right' (note the US spelling of `center` required by CSS):

![align select control](/images/step_6/align_select_control.png)

We have all the elements we need for controlling our caption, but they aren't active yet. Changing the values does nothing to the position or the  style of the caption. We'll fix that in the next step.
