# Tweeting your success!
There's not much point building a website if you can't share it with your friends!  In the final step, we'll add a button that enables you - and anyone else - to tweet your application along with their current image and caption selections.  The latter part takes a bit of additional JavaScript that is already included in `support.js`.  You should definitely have a look at it - but you don't need to understand it at this stage.

## Get the Tweet button code
Twitter provides many developer resources, including some handy [code snippets for Tweet buttons and so on](https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons#tweet):

On the right you'll see the appropriate HTML code to include on your page. Copy it to the `index.erb` file right after `#caption-controls`, putting it into its own `<div>` element with the id of "twitter".

```html
<div id="twitter">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-size="large" data-text="Today I finished building a 'Motivational Posters' website!">Tweet</a>
  <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>
</div>
```

Refresh the page. Now you should see the tweet button below the caption controls:

So now you can send a tweet to all your followers and show them the awesome website you've built!
